      <li>#1. Explain the purpose of whitespace in HTML.</li>
      <li> - White space in HTMl doesn't effect how the code is read by the Browser however, it is used to maintain readability and structure<br>
      for the developer to easily navigate and interperate code. Whitespace should be used appropriatly, just enough to 
      maintain order but not so much that it creates "voids" and wastes space.</li>
      <!-- <li>#2. Demonstrate the process for "commenting out" a line of HTML code, by commenting out this line.</li> -->
      <li>#3. Explain and fix the HTML bug in the next line of code:
        <p>There's something wrong with this line... what is it?</p>
        <p>The p tag was improperly closed it was missing the "<" symbol.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>#4. Explain and fix the HTML bug in the next line of code:
        <p><strong>There's something wrong with this line... what is it?</strong></p>
        <p>The strong tag was closed after the paragraph or p tag. Nested tags should be closed in the reverse sequence they were opened.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>#5. Explain and fix the HTML bug in the next line of code:
        <img src="kitty.png" alt="A picture of my cat">
        <p>The value for the alternate text attribute for the image wasn't enclosed in quotes "". This would work if
          the value didn't have any spaces.
        </p>
